        <p>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not
           seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different.
          Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home.
          That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know,
           everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was,
            lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and
            suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies,
          and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every
          hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization,
          every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
          every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
          every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
          every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint
          and sinner in the history of our species lived there â€“ on
           a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

            strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
            civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before!

            Here's how it is: Earth got used up, so we terraformed
             a whole new galaxy of Earths, some rich and flush with
             the new technologies, some not so much. Central Planets,
              them was formed the Alliance, waged war to bring
              everyone under their rule; a few idiots tried to fight
               it, among them myself. I'm Malcolm Reynolds, captain
                of Serenity. Got a good crew: fighters, pilot,
                 mechanic. We even picked up a preacher, and a bona
