                    Ducati enters the cruiser world and does so in its very own way, presenting a real cruiser but one that boasts the design, technical content and performance that is typical of Ducati bikes. The XDiavel is “low speed excitement”, where the relaxed low-speed riding is typical of the cruiser world, while the excitement and adrenalin of sports riding is unmistakeably Ducati. The X in XDiavel represents precisely that: Two apparently different, distant worlds that come together in one unique bike, a synthesis in which both are complete, without compromise.

                      standards, demanding the highest levels of reliability
                      and providing the parts with a 24 month warranty.
                      Original Ducati Spare Parts are tested by the development centre and have been designed and produced so that the performance and enjoyment that Ducati bikes offer day after day remain unchanged over time. It is only by choosing Original Spare Parts that the bikes of all Ducati customers are able to maintain their true value over time, together with the attention to detail with which they are produced: performance and enjoyment are only guaranteed by the perfect harmony of all the parts.
